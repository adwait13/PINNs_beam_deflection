# Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Beam Deflection

This repository contains TensorFlow implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model deflection in cantilever beams under two different loading conditions:

1. **Point Load at Free End**
2. **Linear Distributed Load**

The models embed Eulerâ€“Bernoulli beam theory into the loss function to ensure physically accurate predictions without relying on labeled data.
